# Electric-Vehicle-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

Iâ€™ve recently completed an exciting analysis and prediction project on Electric Vehicle (EV) data using machine learning techniques. The goal was to predict the electric range of vehicles based on various factors such as the make, model, and year of the vehicle.

Key Steps in the Project:

Data Exploration:
 The dataset consists of over 230,000 EV records, including attributes like VIN, city, state, model year, make, model, electric range, and MSRP. I handled missing values, duplicated records, and performed data transformation for analysis.

Visualization:
 I explored key insights with visualizations:
EV adoption over the years
Distribution of electric range
MSRP and electric range comparisons across vehicle types
Location mapping of EVs (highlighting vehicle concentration)

Model Building & Evaluation:
 I applied various machine learning models:
Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor were used for predicting the electric range.
After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the Random Forest model achieved an RÂ² score of 1.00 and an MSE of 0.00, providing highly accurate predictions.

Results:
 The final model outperformed the baseline dummy regressor, showing a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy.

Takeaways:
Predictive models can play a significant role in forecasting the performance and specifications of EVs, contributing to better decision-making in the industry.

Machine learning techniques, when applied correctly, can provide valuable insights and assist in solving real-world problems.

ðŸ”— I'm excited to share this project and would love to hear your thoughts on how machine learning is transforming the automotive industry, especially in the EV space!
